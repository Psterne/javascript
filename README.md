Ten Simple Javascript Exercises

2.1. Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct
available in Javascript.

2.3. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.

2.5. Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array
of numbers. For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.
